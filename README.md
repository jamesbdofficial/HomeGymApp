# HomeGymApp
An app I plan to host on  raspberry pi in my home gym, still in early development.

Attached to this Raspberry Pi, there will be a key fob reader, and regular users (my friends) will each be given a programmed fob.
When they enter the gym, they scan their fob on the reader, the raspberry pi will then turn on the lights, and unlock the screen for the user to use Spotify while they exercise.

The user will be able to record their exercises through the app running on the pi (if they want), and when they're finally done, they scan their fob on the reader again.
This will create an entry in a database with the information of:
- Who used the gym
- The time and date their session started
- The time and date their session finished
- Any exercises they recorded

They can then view their information through the app on the pi, with charts and graphs showing information like: session lengths, exercises & weights history, etc.
